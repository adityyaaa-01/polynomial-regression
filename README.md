# Polynomial Regression - Practice and Visualization

This repository contains my practice and revision work on **Polynomial Regression**, a type of regression that models the relationship between the independent variable `x` and the dependent variable `y` as an nth-degree polynomial.

## 📌 Objective

The goal is to understand how polynomial regression fits non-linear data better than simple linear regression, especially when the data exhibits curve-like patterns.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Difference between linear and polynomial regression
- Generating polynomial features using `PolynomialFeatures` from `sklearn`
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of predictions

## 📊 Libraries Used

- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`

## 📈 Visualization

Included plots show:
- Actual vs predicted values
- Regression curve fitting the data

## 📁 Files

- `PolynomialRegression.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with code and outputs
